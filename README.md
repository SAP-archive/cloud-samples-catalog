## Samples for the Application Programming Model for SAP Cloud Platform

The following samples give you more hands-on practice with the [application programming model for SAP Cloud Platform](https://help.sap.com/viewer//65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/00823f91779d4d42aa29a498e0535cdf.html):

* Part 1 - [Foundation](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-samples-foundation)
* Part 2 - Product Catalog (current repository)
* Part 3 - [ITelO Catalog](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-samples-itelo)

### Part 2 - Product Catalog (Reuse Scenario)

The Product Catalog shows a sample business application, developed by reusing the CDS models from [Foundation](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-samples-foundation).

The application allows a user to create, delete and modify products of a product catalog.

Technically the sample consists of:

* a CDS model (find more information [here](https://help.sap.com/viewer//65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/855e00bd559742a3b8276fbed4af1008.html))
* an automatic Java OData V2 exposure extended by individual business logic (find more information [here](https://help.sap.com/viewer//65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/68af515a26d944c38d81fd92ad33681e.html))
* a UI based on SAP Fiori elements (find more information [here](https://help.sap.com//SAPUI5_PDF/SAPUI5.pdf)).

This application is only an example and not intended for productive use.

## Requirements

SAP Web IDE Full-Stack access is needed. For more information, see [Open SAP Web IDE](https://help.sap.com/viewer/825270ffffe74d9f988a0f0066ad59f0/CF/en-US/51321a804b1a4935b0ab7255447f5f84.html).

## Development in SAP Cloud Platform Web IDE

Read the [getting started tutorial](https://help.sap.com/viewer//65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/5ec8c983a0bf43b4a13186fcf59015fc.html) to learn more about working with SAP Cloud Platform Web IDE.

Now clone your fork of this repository (*File -> Git -> Clone Repository*).

### Develop, Build, Deploy

To build and deploy your application or modify it and redeploy, use any of the following options:

* Build and deploy the DB module by choosing *Build* from the context menu of the db folder.

* Build and deploy the Java service by choosing *Run -> Run as -> Java application* from the context menu of the srv folder. To test the service, click the URL displayed in the Run Console. Use the endpoint of the service *clouds.products.CatalogService* to call $metadata or CRUD requests.

* Test the UI by choosing *Run -> Run as -> SAP Fiori Launchpad Sandbox* from the context menu of the app folder. Click on the app tile to launch the application.

## Known Issues

* The read only field _Availability_ is enabled occasionally when creating a new Product.
* When running the module "srv" as Java Application the log shows "CfDeployException: Failed to deploy application". In the file "mta.yaml", change all occurrences of "product-catalog-java" to "srv". Repeat build and run.
